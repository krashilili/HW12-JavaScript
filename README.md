# HW12 - JavaScript and DOM Manipulation  

### How to search?  
* You can search for results by inputting the elements such as `datetime`, `city`, `state`, `country` and `shape`. And the Javascript will filter the data based on 
these elements.  If you leave out the element, the filter does not take effect upon this item. If all elements are left empty, then the whole dataset will be presented.

* **Error message** - If your inputs does not match with any record in the dataset, it alarms the error message on the website.
